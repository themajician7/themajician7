- 👋 Hi, I’m @themajician7 I'm a 25 year old female with a BS in Chemistry. I am trying to learn some new skills and coding has always been intriguing to me. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python, SQL, and R! My main focus is Python as I want to learn how to make programs that allow me to do some automated data analytics. I want to apply these skills in the fields of drug discovery, healthcare, and economics. Or really anything, anyone who has projects for a beginner like me I would be super grateful. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything that will help me develop my skills. Once I get down the basics then I can start to apply it to my specified interests. 
- 📫 How to reach me my email is themajician7@gmail.com
